        <P>Vial of Life is a lightweight and simple Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system.
            Before the use of computers was widely spread, people would write down
            their past medical history and list of medications on a small peice of paper.
            They would then roll up the peice of paper and put it in a tube to be placed in the freezer.
            This way when an ill or elderly person had a emergency, EMTs would know to look in the freezer
            for the patients medical information enclosed in a "Vial of Life".</P>
